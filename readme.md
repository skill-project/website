Since the dawn of time, humanity has never ceased to learn – individually as well as collectively. Over millennia, we have mastered an incredibly large number of skills, and continue to do so; yet, we lack a comprehensive and organised database of all human skills.

We firmly believe that with the power of modern technology, it is possible to map out all human skills. However, the only smart way of doing so, is by leveraging collective knowledge and making everyone a part of this effort. In this age of advanced social tools, big data technologies and data science applications, imagine what we could do with this data!

### Our Mission

Our aim is to build the largest and most accurate multilingual skills database ever made, by allowing a diverse and skilful community to contribute their individual skills to the global map. The database is available for anyone to use, free of charge with a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 licence.

Because the data is the result of many people’s voluntary effort, along with ours, we allow anyone to export the data as a CSV, and plan to eventually make an API through which users can get access to it as well.

### How Can You Help?

In our graph structure, each skill can be split into more specific sub-skills. What you need to do is add your own skills in the most appropriate section.

You don’t need an account to browse the skill database or to download it. However, if you want to add your skills or share thoughts about existing ones, you will need to sign up.

You can even apply to become an Editor. Editors have the ability to edit skills added by other users.

You can also contribute in the website code as well by creating a Pull Request.
