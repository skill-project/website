        <h3><?= _("Our Services"); ?></h3>
        <p>Skill Project is dedicated to building a comprehensive human skills multilingual database. Our role is to host the database and the tools to edit it, which can be found <a href="http://www.skill-project.org" alt="Skill Project">here</a>. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the skills database by contributing and editing skills themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you and the other users:</p>
        <ol >
            <li><b>We do not take an editorial role:</b> Because the skills database is collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Skill Project website, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited. </li>
            <li><b>You are responsible for your own actions:</b> You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Skill Project, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of France where Skill Project is currently hosted. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn Editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. Skill Project generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification. </li>
        </ol>

            <li>Make Skill Project more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on Skill Project along with the dates that other accounts were created on Skill Project. Information available through public logs will not include personal information about you.</p>
